ONL 4: Design for online and blended learning

We learned from the pandemic that we have to be adaptable and flexible. Like everyone else, I had to move to remote teaching. Now that we have been in this situation for almost two years, it has become online or hybrid teaching. I have realised the value of hybrid teaching or blended learning. Why blended learning? Because it offers so many opportunities. For me, it is getting the best from online and face-to-face learning.

Now bringing the best is not that straightforward (or easy), and it requires a careful course design. As Martin Weller discussed in the [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fav9zsU1Zpo), we sometimes think we have adopted new educational strategies using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). But if we reflect and use the evidence collected in our teaching, we realise we hardly have changed our pedagogy.

The key idea is to engage students to get ownership of their learning. Designing effective learning activities is probably the most important (well, for me), and I intend to develop more in my courses. This Open University Learning Design team [resource](http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/learning-design/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Collaborative-activities-booklet-V2.5-compressed-5.pdf) is particularly useful for designing and conducting collaborative online activities.

Another aspect I am trying to work on is developing collaborative learning within the class. I found it was easier online for bigger classes as they can discuss on forums outside class times. However, it was limited. Students post questions, and a few eager students bounce ideas, but most of the time, I answer the questions. I am not sure if it is because of competition, lack of confidence, or time. I am hoping to get better strategies to encourage online peer support without making it compulsory.
