1. In topic 2, we discussed the complexity, benefits, and challenges of open education and pedagogy. One of the interesting components was teaching and learning in a community. So Topic 3 is a natural continuation of the discussion.

   In our group, we decided to focus on finding the best strategies to develop collaborative learning inside the classroom and beyond it. The classroom offers a safe space for students to develop collaborative skills, and opportunities to build networks can be done outside the classroom.

   It was pretty useful because I strongly believe in collaborative learning (online and face-to-face), and it allowed me to reflect on my teaching practices. Many of my assignments are based on group work. I realised that for some courses, especially first and second-year students, I am very involved in their group work, but I am less involved in other courses (third-year or even Master's students). Probably because I imagine, at this level, they are already familiar with the process and have acquired the skills. After discussing with my group and reading Brindley, Blaschke & Walti, C. (2009) and Capdeferro & Romero  (2012), it is clear that instructional strategies should be implemented systematically. 

   It is worth listing the sources of frustration that Capdeferro & Romero  (2012) found from surveying 40 students from an online Master's programme involved in collaborative learning experiences:

   (a) imbalance in the level of commitment, responsibility, and effort, 

   (b) unshared goals and difficulties in organization, 

   (c) difficulties in communication/dialogue in terms of frequency, 

   (d) problems with negotiation skills

   (e) imbalance in quality of individual contributions

   (f) excess of time spent and workload

    (g) conflict and problems in reaching consensus

   (h) imbalance between individual expected mark and group mark

   (i) misunderstandings 

   (j) lack of instructor's support/orientation

   

   Some issues are outside our control; however, we can significantly help the effectiveness of group collaboration by choosing appropriate instructional designs. Brindley, Blaschke & Walti (2009) shared strategies they used in their online Master's programme to show students the value of collaborative learning and engage them in this experience. Here are some key components I find especially useful:

   1. Clear expectations: Tell the students when they will work in groups, for what assignments, and the benefits (now and in the future) they will gain.
   2. Clear instructions for the task: What are they meant to find out as a group? Give them clear directions with learning objectives and assessment rubrics. As a clear structure is essential, making sure they have the space to exercise their independent learning is crucial.
   3. Guidance for collaborative work: Impart the necessary skills for the students to work effectively as a group. It is best achieved with a scaffolded strategy.
   4. Appropriate task: Choosing the right task is important to realise the benefits of working together.
   5. Relevance & connections: Connect to the students' prior knowledge and new knowledge. Provide an opportunity for authentic learning. Get students to give feedback to each other.
   6. Developing rapport: People work best when comfortable with each other, and it takes time. It is worth giving low stake activities for students to bond with others.
   7. Follow group progress & give feedback. Students need to be supported in their collaborative learning. Sometimes it is just a matter of improving their self-efficacy, and other times it helps them address learning challenges.
   8. Give enough time for students to carry out their assignments and make the most of the experience. Also, avoid unnecessary stress.

   

   

   Collaborative work is a small part of learning in communities. Connected learning has so many layers, so it will take time to understand its full potential. I have a lot to explore!





@article{Capdeferro2012,
   abstract = {Online education increasingly puts emphasis on collaborative learning methods. Despite the pedagogical advantages of collaborative learning, online learners can perceive collab-orative learning activities as frustrating experiences. The purpose of this study was to characterize the feelings of frustration as a negative emotion among online learners engaged in online computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) experiences and, moreover, to identify the sources to which the learners attribute their frustration. With this aim, a questionnaire was designed to obtain data from a sample of online learners participating in the Master of ICT and Education program of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). Results revealed that frustration is a common feeling among students involved in online collaborative learning experiences. The perception of an asymmetric collaboration among the teammates was identified by the students as the most important source of frustration. Online learners also identified difficulties related to group organization, the lack of shared goals among the team members, the imbalance in the level of commitment and quality of the individual contributions, the excess time spent on the online CSCL tasks, the imbalance between the individual and collective grades, and difficulties in communication, among other factors leading to frustration. The analysis of the students' sources of frustration in online CSCL is followed by a list of recommendations to the distance education stakehold-ers, aiming to reduce students' frustration and improve the quality of their experiences in online CSCL contexts such as the UOC.},

   abstract = {Collaborative learning in an online classroom can take the form of discussion among the whole class or within smaller groups. This paper addresses the latter, examining first whether assessment makes a difference to the level of learner participation and then considering other factors involved in creating effective collaborative learning groups. Data collected over a three year period (15 cohorts) from the Foundations course in the Master of Distance Education (MDE) program offered jointly by University of Maryland University College (UMUC) and the University of Oldenburg does not support the authors" original hypothesis that assessment makes a significant difference to learner participation levels in small group learning projects and leads them to question how much emphasis should be placed on grading work completed in study groups to the exclusion of other strategies. Drawing on observations of two MDE courses, including the Foundations course, their extensive online teaching experience, and a review of the literature, the authors identify factors other than grading that contribute positively to the effectiveness of small collaborative learning groups in the online environment. In particular, the paper focuses on specific instructional strategies that facilitate learner participation in small group projects, which result in an enhanced sense of community, increased skill acquisition, and better learning outcomes.},
