The term “openly” can have many meanings in everyday life depending where, who and for what we are using it. Using \" Open learning and teaching\" is even more complex.\nMy only knowledge about open education was primarily with open educational resources (OER). Starting with MIT OpenCoursWare ocw.mit.edu to PHET phet.colorado.edu to the many MOOCs out there. Actually this semester the course I am teaching, I am using/recommending to my students the educational resources shared by David Harvey (see here) Professor of Chemistry & Biochemistry at DePauw University. Once he got the copyright of his book Modern Analytical Chemistry (published in 1999 by McGraw-Hill), he decided to share and revisit its content online. Not only he is sharing content about analytical chemistry but also he offers very useful simulations (I am using the Cyclic Voltammetry simulation in class and recommend it to people). I had the chance to correspond with him with my final year project student while working on an educational project and I must say he was very helpful. I found his initiative wonderful and I am glad I get the chance to thank him here.\nOf course I have also shared my teaching materials or talks with people who requested them but I have never shared them online openly. Although I am not opposed to it, I haven’t thought about the proper and safest way to do it.\nOER are wonderful tools if used properly. Often preparing our lecture notes and other materials are the first steps of our course design. When you teach traditional topics most of the content is in textbooks and hence in OER as well. Do we have to re-invent the wheel? Is it ok to refer students to OER for the content? Would the students accept other educator’s lectures for example or would they feel cheated? They already do accept reading textbooks and papers but when it comes to let’s say videos, I find they react differently. It would be interesting to see if we can design a course based on OER and the educator just focus on the processes of teaching & learning and the outcome rather than preparing the content. I wonder if it will allow us to have more time to improve our teaching?\nThis leads me to Open Educational Practices (OEP) and that part is definitely more complicated. I still have a lot to explore but I have found the concept of “open pedagogy” quite interesting. In the OER Starter Kit, an open textbook, there is a section on open pedagogy. Using open pedagogy involves using OER but also developing new OER with students. They encourage the use of renewable assignments where students’ work is to be shared with the Community and contribute to OER. I have done a few times, assignments where students had to create videos to help the public to understand complex scientific issues and help informed decision making. I guess this might be considered as open pedagogy?\n(Cronin 2017) discussed how open practices are complex, personal, contextual and all the time negotiated. It is important to have a supportive environment and a collaborative efforts between the university, staff and students. It seems a bit daunting to venture fully in open practices and if one wants, I think it is difficult to do it on your own without support or guidance.\nAlan, our facilitator shared with us an article by (Moscardini, Strachan, and Vlasova 2020) discussing the role of universities in modern society. They are sharing how higher education has to adapt to a society where internet is the main source of information and the main platform for knowledge exchange. They emphasise how the role of university teacher will be more a guide or mentor and how we should learn about Wikinomics which is about mass collaboration and openness.\nSo at the end maybe we won’t have so much choice and we should start preparing…\n\n\n\nCronin, Catherine. 2017. “Open Education, Open Questions.” EDUCAUSE Review 52. https://er.educause.edu/articles/2017/10/open-education-open-questions.\n\n\nMoscardini, A.

    "contents": "\nNow begins my blogging journey! Exciting but stressful at the same time.\nTime has flown by very fast since the beginning of the Open Networked Learning course on Monday 20th September. We spent two weeks getting familiar with the online course structure and getting to know our Problem-based Learning (PBL) group.\nIt is my first time to get to know and work with people I only met online. We are all aware of the challenges (and benefits) of collaborative work. Usually, working with your colleagues face-to-face requires organization. Imagine working with people in a different time zone with a different working environment (I am in Singapore while all my group members are in Finland and Sweden… Scandinavia?…do correct me please!).\nSurprisingly it went pretty smoothly… only because we were well guided at the beginning of this online journey. Our facilitator Alan (who I know from our home institution, National University of Singapore) has prepared us well. I realise the importance of spending time on getting familiar with the learning environment, not to be impeded with it. We also have Luis to help us in this journey, and I think having two people to guide us is not a luxury. Online infrastructure is essential.\nAfter the first two weeks, we tackled our first problem, which focused on digital literacies. The case study presented an educator who enrolled in an online course and is anxious about doing blogs for the first time but acknowledges the importance of social media. I completely related to that. I don’t use social media in my private life, but I also know it can be a helpful tool.\nTo help us understand the digital realm, a webinar was organised on Digital literacies with David White and Jörg Pareigis.\nDavid White presented his Visitors and Residents paradigm (White and Cornu 2011). The key idea is that there is a continuum of web engagement. From the Visitors who only use the internet to do Google search to the Residents who have a constant online presence and online interactions, i.e., an online identity. I like the idea of “digital footprint” to measure digital identity. The other idea is that you could be a Digital Resident in your private life and a Digital Visitor in your professional life or vice-versa.\nOnline engagement is inevitable, especially when you cannot access any more physical places. People have different needs and motivations in different contexts, and therefore their online engagement will change accordingly. The easiest case, it is when you don’t think too much about it. For example, you need to buy food, find a doctor or stay up-to-date with safety measures. In these examples, you have a clear goal and procedure; to be independent, you may want to learn to do it yourself. Here, I would like to share with you about my amazing mother. She was born in France, but my grandparents immigrated from Algeria after World War II; she left school very young to work, worked in a factory and her shop later, and had five rowdy kids (me included). It all started with Skype many years ago because I left France and Skype was cheaper to communicate. Then with affordable smartphones (thanks Xiaomi) came Viber. She was only calling first and gradually texting and now sending photos (she recently learned screen capture too!) in our family group. But the best is Netflix. Netflix is a person at home. She wanted to install Netflix on all TVs at home. The problem is some TVs are old. None of my sisters and I could fix the problem. My mum stubbornly (Mediterranean stubbornness) decided to find the solution on her own and asked Google (“Hey Google”). Google led her to Youtube… and she found the help of a YouTuber!\nSo now, every time he has a problem, she goes on Youtube. Clear goals and Clear motivations.\nI often think if my mum had gone to school, she would be a hacker by now. She is such a good example of self-learning in developing her digital literacies.\nHe got me thinking about acquiring new digital skills and exploring new online spaces.\nDo you want to use a new tool or platform?\nCan you use this new tool or platform?\nDo you need to use this new tool or platform?\nMaybe it is a good start to reflect on our current digital status. The Visitor/Resident vs Personal/Institution map, proposed by David White and discussed during the webinar, helps find out our digital status at a specific time. First, it helps us think about what we are doing and why. Eventually, it can help to decide on “where” we want to go with our digital goals. The “how” is probably the tricky one…\n\n\n\nWhite, David S., and Alison Le Cornu. 2011. “Visitors and Residents: A New Typology for Online Engagement.” First Monday, August. https://doi.org/10.5210/fm.v16i9.3171.\n\n\n\n\n",
